I am currently a **student in the CSIE (5-year program)**. I started programming in middle school through Roblox Studio, which sparked my interest in **game design and interactive logic**. Over time, I expanded my skills into **full-stack web development, data handling, and automation tools**.  

I focus on **solving real problems and completing usable projects** rather than just learning syntax. Even as a student, I have hands-on experience spanning front-end, back-end, and game systems, which has helped me develop a more mature approach to coding and project management.  

I enjoy taking ideas all the way to something tangible:  
- From **e-commerce and personal portfolio websites** to multiple versions of site restructuring, learning how to integrate UI/UX and data flows  
- From **Discord bots, crawlers, and automation tools** to backend processing and performance optimization  
- From **game combat systems and frameworks** to full feature testing, strengthening my programming logic and system thinking  

I mainly work with **Next.js, Tailwind CSS, TypeScript, Python, Lua/Luau, and C/C++**, and Iâ€™m continuously learning **algorithms, data structures, and system design** to build a solid foundation.  

My goal is to combine **full-stack development skills with game design thinking**, taking on meaningful projects while challenging myself and creating real value. I like turning ideas into usable productsâ€”whether websites, tools, or gamesâ€”and I believe that practical experience is the best teacher. Even as a student, I am already building and shipping projects, which I consider my biggest advantage.
